    "Some common technique are:\n",
    "    L1 Regularization (Lasso): L1 regularization is a technique that adds a penalty term to the cost function of the learning algorithm, encouraging sparse solutions by shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero. As a result, L1 regularization can effectively select a subset of relevant features while performing model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization): Ridge regression is another regularization technique that adds a penalty term to the cost function. Unlike L1 regularization, Ridge regression does not enforce sparsity, but it can help reduce the impact of irrelevant features by shrinking their coefficients. While it doesn't perform explicit feature selection, it can indirectly downweight less relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net: Elastic Net combines the L1 and L2 regularization techniques by adding a linear combination of their penalty terms to the cost function. It can balance between the advantages of Lasso (sparsity) and Ridge regression (stability). Elastic Net can effectively handle situations where there are correlated features and performs feature selection by encouraging sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree-based Methods: Decision tree algorithms, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), naturally perform feature selection as part of their learning process. These algorithms evaluate the importance of features based on their contribution to the tree's splits or the reduction in impurity. Important features are favored during tree construction, and less important features are less frequently used. The feature importances obtained from these algorithms can be used for feature selection."

Choose a metric that aligns with the project goals and the business's specific needs.\n",

Some common scoring functions for the Filter Method in feature selection include Pearson's correlation coefficient, chi-square test, information gain, or mutual information. The choice of the scoring function depends on the nature of the features (categorical or continuous) and the target variable.\n",
